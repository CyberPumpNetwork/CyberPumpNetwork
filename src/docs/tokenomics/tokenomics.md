# Token & Ecosystem

The **$CYPU** token is the heart of the kas.me ecosystem. Built on Kaspa as a KRC-20 token, it embodies fair-launch principles, transparent distribution, and sustainable growth.

## Overview

kas.me isn't just another platform with a token attached. The entire ecosystem is designed around **cohesion** – a system whose survival depends on the interconnectedness of its users.

The token serves multiple purposes:
- **Platform Access** – Premium features and advanced analytics
- **Governance** – Community-driven decision making
- **Rewards** – Incentivize participation and contributions
- **Utility** – Powers the CyberPumpNetwork infrastructure
