# First Ever Dev Talk

## 72 Days After Token Launch

Probably the most intense and emotional step in this entire journey.
Also the riskiest, because it meant accepting that I had no idea where the road would lead.

## What is kas.me?

What is kas.me?
What will it eventually become?
I will not define that here, and I should not. If you know, you know.

What matters is the origin.
The mindset.
The reason the work began.

## The Journey Timeline

### 2019 — First Contact

In 2019 I stumbled into something called "Blockchain".
I played around with it, wasted some money like an idiot, and walked away.
Less than a year later I returned, not to profit, but to understand what was actually happening.

What is Bitcoin?
Why do people take it seriously?
Why is it not simply a pyramid scheme?

These questions pulled me deeper than I expected.

### The Learning Phase

Over the next two years I learned far more than I ever planned.
And still, the feeling remained that I was missing the bigger picture.

I started mining.
Stopped again for the wrong reasons.
I treated it like a money machine, not a long-term learning process.

### 2022 / Early 2023 — First Time Hearing "Kaspa"

I heard about Kaspa.
Did I mine it? No.
I genuinely thought it was a scam.

### 2024 — Deeper Understanding

By 2024 I was not "invested".
I was obsessed with understanding.
Someone close to me mentioned Kaspa again.

Back then my knowledge was still basic, shaped by my beliefs about Bitcoin and the ecosystem around it.
When I finally took a second look, something clicked.

Goosebumps.
Embarrassment.
Realization.

I remembered the day I refused to mine Kaspa because it was cheap and would never catch on.
Time taught me otherwise in its own way.

It took almost a year until I bought my first Kaspa in 2025.

## Intention Shift

Let us be honest.
At first I wanted to get rich.
Many people start that way.

But the deeper I understood the space, the more my priorities changed.
I still want to make money and I will not pretend otherwise,
but I want to do it in a way that fits my values, my logic, and my view of the world.

## Why kas.me Began

The reason I started building kas.me is simple, even if it sounds unusual.

There are two types of people in this space.
Those who know, and those who do not.
One and Zero.

My brother is a Zero.
He knows a little but barely scratches the surface.
I became a One, not a professional, not special, but someone who connected thousands of dots until the picture began to resemble 3D chess.

I am still not where I want to be.
Not rich, but wealthy in knowledge.
Time passed, I benefited, my brother did not.

That was the moment I realized something important.
Many people face the same gap.
I did not plan to care about it, yet the idea grew beyond anything I expected.

## The Spark

Planning for kas.me began in 2025, right after my first Kaspa buy.

At first the idea was small.
Maybe an explorer.
Maybe analytics.
Something simple that saved money and helped manage my own insights.

But the idea grew.
I started researching HFT, arbitrage, and the mechanisms people use in closed rooms to generate massive gains while barely doing anything themselves.

Algorithms.
Code.
Knowledge.

My view of fairness shifted.
And I began asking myself:
Why should only a few have access to powerful tools?
Why is this knowledge not accessible to everyone?

That question became the foundation.

## Where This All Leads

kas.me is not defined by promises or predictions.
It is defined by intention.
By the belief that tools, information, and understanding should not be locked inside closed rooms and private groups.

The journey began with curiosity, mistakes, and realizations.
It continues through building something aligned with that philosophy.

Whatever kas.me becomes, it started with one simple thought:
**Give people the ability to understand and act, just like anyone else.**
