# Behind the Scenes: Dev Talks

**Personal insights, journey reflections, and the story behind kas.me – unfiltered thoughts from the founder.**

## About Dev Talks

Dev Talks are not technical documentation. They are **personal reflections**, **honest thoughts**, and **the story** of how kas.me came to be.

These are the **Easter eggs** – hidden layers of intent, philosophy, and vision that unfold over time. Some parts you'll understand immediately. Others might only make sense years later.

This is not about selling a token or promising a future.
**This is about starting a conversation. Making you think.**
