      What is kas.me?<br>
      What will it eventually become?<br>
      I will not define that here, and I should not. If you know, you know.<br><br>
      What matters is the origin.<br>
      The mindset.<br>
      The reason the work began.

    <h3>The Journey Timeline</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>2019 — First Contact</dt>
      <dd>
        In 2019 I stumbled into something called “Blockchain”.  
        I played around with it, wasted some money like an idiot, and walked away.  
        Less than a year later I returned, not to profit, but to understand what was actually happening.<br><br>
        What is Bitcoin?  
        Why do people take it seriously?  
        Why is it not simply a pyramid scheme?<br><br>
        These questions pulled me deeper than I expected.
      </dd>

      <dt>The Learning Phase</dt>
      <dd>
        Over the next two years I learned far more than I ever planned.  
        And still, the feeling remained that I was missing the bigger picture.<br><br>
        I started mining.  
        Stopped again for the wrong reasons.  
        I treated it like a money machine, not a long-term learning process.
      </dd>

      <dt>2022 / Early 2023 — First Time Hearing “Kaspa”</dt>
      <dd>
        I heard about Kaspa.  
        Did I mine it? No.  
        I genuinely thought it was a scam.
      </dd>

      <dt>2024 — Deeper Understanding</dt>
      <dd>
        By 2024 I was not “invested”.  
        I was obsessed with understanding.  
        Someone close to me mentioned Kaspa again.<br><br>
        Back then my knowledge was still basic, shaped by my beliefs about Bitcoin and the ecosystem around it.  
        When I finally took a second look, something clicked.<br><br>
        Goosebumps.  
        Embarrassment.  
        Realization.<br><br>
        I remembered the day I refused to mine Kaspa because it was cheap and would never catch on.  
        Time taught me otherwise in its own way.<br><br>
        It took almost a year until I bought my first Kaspa in 2025.

    <h3>Intention Shift</h3>
    <p>
      Let us be honest.  
      At first I wanted to get rich.  
      Many people start that way.<br><br>
      But the deeper I understood the space, the more my priorities changed.  
      I still want to make money and I will not pretend otherwise,  
      but I want to do it in a way that fits my values, my logic, and my view of the world.
    </p>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>Why kas.me Began</h3>
    <p>
      The reason I started building kas.me is simple, even if it sounds unusual.<br><br>
      There are two types of people in this space.  
      Those who know, and those who do not.  
      One and Zero.<br><br>
      My brother is a Zero.  
      He knows a little but barely scratches the surface.  
      I became a One, not a professional, not special, but someone who connected thousands of dots until the picture began to resemble 3D chess.<br><br>
      I am still not where I want to be.  
      Not rich, but wealthy in knowledge.  
      Time passed, I benefited, my brother did not.<br><br>
      That was the moment I realized something important.  
      Many people face the same gap.  
      I did not plan to care about it, yet the idea grew beyond anything I expected.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>The Spark</h3>
    <p>
      Planning for kas.me began in 2025, right after my first Kaspa buy.<br><br>
      At first the idea was small.  
      Maybe an explorer.  
      Maybe analytics.  
      Something simple that saved money and helped manage my own insights.<br><br>
      But the idea grew.  
      I started researching HFT, arbitrage, and the mechanisms people use in closed rooms to generate massive gains while barely doing anything themselves.<br><br>
      Algorithms.  
      Code.  
      Knowledge.<br><br>
      My view of fairness shifted.  
      And I began asking myself:  
      Why should only a few have access to powerful tools?  
      Why is this knowledge not accessible to everyone?<br><br>
      That question became the foundation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>Where This All Leads</h3>
    <p>
      kas.me is not defined by promises or predictions.  
      It is defined by intention.  
      By the belief that tools, information, and understanding should not be locked inside closed rooms and private groups.<br><br>
      The journey began with curiosity, mistakes, and realizations.  
      It continues through building something aligned with that philosophy.<br><br>
      Whatever kas.me becomes, it started with one simple thought:  
      <br>Give people the ability to understand and act, just like anyone else.
