    <h1>Dev Talk II — Absurd Megalomania</h1>
    <p class="intro">After the first Dev Talk, I want to share more of the intent behind what you are witnessing here. Some already treat this project like a puzzle - full of hints, layers, and Easter eggs that unfold over time.</p>
    <p class="intro"> Some appear immediately, others only years later.<br><br> And all of this is intentional.</p>
    <p class="intro">Explaining what will eventually arise is nearly impossible without sounding insane, arrogant, or simply cryptic.</p>
    <p class="intro"> So I decided to guide this journey in a way that forces you to think on your own - far deeper than you might expect in the beginning. The more you dive in, the more contradictions you notice, the more references you catch, the more the picture sharpens.<br><br> My goal was never “buy my token”.<br> My goal is: start thinking.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Myself</h2>

    <p>Before turning 20, I finally understood something fundamental about myself:<br> I am a builder - an architect of systems, not just ideas. I simply never knew what I wanted to dedicate my life to.<br> Until now.<br> This is not a declaration of war. This is my declaration of freedom - for everyone who wants to participate.<br><br> And yes, “absurd megalomania” is exactly what I heard in my earliest meetings. The deeper the explanations went, the more surprised people became - because it breaks the rules of crypto and the rules of classic economics at the same time.<br><br> To become something big, you must dream big.<br> Maybe I took that too far.<br> Maybe not far enough.</p>
    
    <h3>My Personal Story</h3>
    <p>Why this determination? Why this level of dedication?<br> Because Kaspa humbled me years ago. It beat me - because I was stupid. And now I want to reclaim my honor.<br> Humor included.<br><br> Kaspa ended up being the perfect asset for this vision. The experience shaped my passion for it.<br> And if I exaggerate: I wouldn’t care if this website took another 50 years to finish.<br> I want it to be perfect - no matter the effort.</p>
    
    <p>I didn't attend university or pursue a degree, which some developers might see as an advantage they have over me.<br> Instead, I've completed a vocational training in computer science and invested thousands of hours in my own knowledge development.<br><br> I'm not what you'd call a traditionally apprenticed developer - I'm a trained computer scientist.<br> Every project tries to present itself from its best side, without showing any "flaws."<br> I show who I am.<br> I show my journey toward my set goal.<br> And you are simply invited to watch.</p>
    
    <p>I don't hide the truth just to promise a beautiful, shiny future.<br> I know the path ahead will be long and hard - and that's exactly what I'm trying to document here. I don't want to create the expectation that you're seeing a perfect Web3 company here - on the contrary, I'm trying to build one.<br><br> In my own way.<br> That's why I say it doesn't matter to me if this process takes 50 years.<br> I'm ready for it.</p>

    <h2>The Paradox</h2>


    <p>This entire ecosystem begins with a paradox - one that even hides inside the project name.<br> On the surface, it looks like a website, maybe even a free one.<br> But if you truly understand that sentence, if you trace its implications, then you already formed your own perspective on every detail available so far.<br><br> Because a “website” is normally nothing more than a business running a page to earn money, or a single person offering a service - possibly even for free.<br> And yet, what you are watching here is something entirely different:<br></p>
    <p> a website without a traditional owner, without corporate structures, without the usual rules - just code, and a system that includes you.</p>
    
    <h3>A Vision Designed to Outlive Me</h3>
    <p>How deep you choose to go is entirely your decision.<br> Think of it like running a "node":<br><br> nothing exists without a node. No node, no website, no service, no survival.<br> Someone has to host.<br> Anyone can host.<br><br> And that is where freedom begins.<br> I am not building “my” website - I am building "yours".<br><br> The moment even one user runs a node, it survives. Even if I am gone. That is cohesion. That is the theory. That is the paradox.<br> This platform - this ecosystem - is designed to survive me. Not through a company generating endless revenue, but through its users. Through nodes. Through participation. Through cohesion. If I die, my node dies; if it’s the only one, the website dies too; but if even a single user keeps hosting, it survives.<br><br> A brutally simple, fair, transparent mechanic.<br> And strangely beautiful.</p>
    
    <p>That is my ambitious goal: not just a website or platform like those currently emerging.<br><br> A platform that is independent.<br><br> If I only wanted to provide a platform, I would have done it quietly long ago and offered it for free - but that's not where my idea has evolved to. It goes much further. What the final product will look like and how it will all function is an extremely ambitious and lengthy journey.<br> It requires endurance.<br> And I have dedicated myself to this mission.</p>

    <h2>Perfect Timing</h2>

    <p>From the outside, the timing might look strange. New services appear every week. Tools pop up everywhere.<br> Some even resemble ideas I’ve mentioned before - intentionally or not.<br> But for me, the timing could not be better.<br><br> These services show what is possible; they increase awareness; they validate concepts I never had to pitch.<br> And they prove something important: I don’t need to rush anything.<br><br> The ecosystem demonstrates the possibilities on its own. Comparing something that does not yet exist makes no sense anyway.<br> And still - I wonder why no one else built something similar.<br> Yes, I say that openly.</p>
    
    <h3>This Dev Talk Is About Me</h3>
    <p>Before the next Dev Talk covers liquidity and its logic - the brutally simple engine that transforms our collective conviction into sustainable, transparent value - this one focuses on myself - my reflections, my perspective, my intent.<br><br> Kaspa already has outstanding services, and that alone sets my benchmark. I’m adding my own layer of vision on top of that.<br> Kaspa is evolving, and it’s not yet where I need it.<br> But that aligns perfectly with the timeline. If you haven’t noticed:<br><br> this project will take years before it unfolds.<br> Not two years.<br> Not five.<br><br> "Step by step".</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Kaspa itself is developing, with everything around IgraLabs, vProgs, and so on forming the foundation I will need. Kaspa provides exactly what makes my endeavor feasible. So, with my vision and goal, it doesn't make sense yet to launch a platform.<br> The foundation for everything I need is just now being created by Kaspa itself.<br> And that makes this timing so perfect.</p>
    
    <p>I am right in the middle of it - in the evolution of Kaspa and in my own.<br> I myself am developing too. Daily progress in Rust / development.<br> Daily deep dives into topics I hadn't even considered before.<br><br> The reason I write this so openly and transparently is simple: I don't want to create false impressions.<br> I want to honestly say what's going on here and at what level we are operating.<br> No pro - no expert - just me.</p>

    <h2>Time  -  My Only Opponent</h2>

    <p>In my first meetings with banks, one sentence stayed with me:<br> “You’re ahead of your time.” <br><br> And yes - time is my biggest enemy, not competition.<br> But reaching this goal is only a matter of time. And here’s the part that matters:<br> even with zero funding, I would still build this.<br> Because I can.<br><br> Because the foundation is brutally simple:<br> me → code → "node" → user → survival.<br><br> I only need to believe in it myself.<br> Everyone else is free to observe, doubt, question, or participate.</p>
    
    <p>That is my core message. Anyone who wants to join should know exactly what they're getting into. My intention is clearly documented.<br><br> No pump - just vision.<br><br> If you understand that, you can participate in the front row of a "movie" whose ending is open.<br> Whether successful or not. Happy end or disaster.</p>
    <p><br> I never wanted to create a "meme coin." I wanted to link my vision of truly fair tools fairly to a "currency" that can endure any time (technically).<br> So all this is not just some asset or website.<br><br> It's my story that I'm sharing with the world.</p>
    
    <p>Banks only see the risk - but they also see the visionary and the entrepreneurship in me.<br> And that has strengthened me, even though I essentially "lost" in the first meetings.<br> Nevertheless, a network of connections has emerged from it that already offers me advantages today and doesn't send me on this journey alone.<br> So the fact that my idea could spark something in "someone else" is the greatest and most honest confirmation I could receive.</p>
    <p> Not the millions in investments that many other founders chase.</p>
    
    <h3>Money Is Not Value</h3>
    <p>One of the most important lessons: money is not value.<br> Money is a tool.<br> The true value - the part that got lost in noise - is cohesion.</p> 
    <p> A system whose survival depends on the interconnectedness of its users. A system that becomes stronger the more individuals take responsibility.</p>
    
    <p>That is my view, which has developed over the years.<br> That is my goal that I've set for myself - without writing it down as a "promise" (or being able to).</p>
    
    <h3>Doubt Is Welcome</h3>
    <p>I genuinely hope many observers have doubts about what is happening here.</p>
    <p><br> Observation forces Doubt.<br> Doubt forces thinking.<br> Thinking leads to understanding.<br> Understanding eventually leads to superiority.<br><br> And superiority creates a feeling of triumph.</p>
    <p> But Triumph is a matter of perspective. And with Perspective - where are back at Observation.</p>
    <p>From my perspective, I had already "won" the moment I pressed “launch” on the token - not in terms of price or profit, because that has never been my metric.<br> I won because I finally found the courage to turn the vision into reality, to take the irreversible step that starts the long journey toward the actual goal.<br> The token launch wasn’t the finish line; it was the starting gun.</p>
    <p> And in that moment, everything I had been building toward for years finally began.<br>Yet, the product will take years until you can fully use it.<br> And that's exactly how it should be.</p>
    
    <p>Anyone who understands this principle also understands that they can "take influence" themselves.<br> Because nothing is set in stone.<br> It's just emerging now.<br> I only had the vision.<br> I also bring the endurance to complete this endeavor.</p>
    <p> The question is only whether I will do this alone.<br> There is no "must" here (whether I must do it alone).</p>
    <p> It's not a compulsion. It's a decision.</p>
    
    <h3>Final Reflection</h3>
    <p>So why all of this?<br> Because I want to invite you, the reader, to reflect:</p>
    <p> Do you already see what I see?</p>
    <p> Or do you still only see<br> The “megalomania”?</p>
